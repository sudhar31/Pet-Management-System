**Pet Management System**

Project Overview:

The Pet Management System is a comprehensive web application designed to manage different types of pets and their behaviors. This project utilizes a modern technology stack including Java Spring Boot for the backend, Angular (with Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, TypeScript) for the frontend, MySQL for the database, and Postman for testing API endpoints. The system aims to streamline pet management tasks, making it easy for users to track and manage their pets effectively.

**Features:**

Backend:

Spring Boot Framework: The backend is developed using Spring Boot, a powerful Java-based framework that simplifies the development of production-ready applications. It provides a robust and scalable backend infrastructure.
RESTful APIs: The application exposes RESTful APIs to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing pets. The APIs are tested using Postman to ensure reliability and correctness.
MySQL Database: The application uses MySQL as the database to store pet information, ensuring data persistence and efficient retrieval.

Frontend:

Angular Framework: The frontend is developed using Angular, a popular framework for building dynamic web applications. It offers a modular architecture and ensures a responsive user interface.
Bootstrap: Integrated with Bootstrap to provide a clean and responsive design, ensuring the application looks great on all devices.
HTML and CSS: Utilized for structuring and styling the web pages, ensuring a user-friendly interface.
TypeScript: Leveraged for better code management and to take advantage of type checking.
